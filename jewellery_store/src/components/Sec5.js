                    many desktop publishing packages and 
                    web page editors now use lorem ipsum 
                    as their default model text, and a 
                    search for lorem ipsum will uncover 
                    many web sites still in their infancy. 
                    various versions have evolved over the years,
                     sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
